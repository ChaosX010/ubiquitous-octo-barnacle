stages of malware analysis and complexity (from less complex to complex)

1.fully automated analysis
2.static property analysis
3.interactive behavior analysis
4.manual code reversing

looking at static properties for an initial assessment
as part of triage
Q.is it malware?
Q.How bad is it?
Q.How to detect it?

  ->look at hashes 
  ->packer identification
  ->Embedded aertifacts
  ->imports and exports
  ->strings
  
behavior analysis examines environment interaction
 execute malware in an isolated windows lab system
 observe how it interacts with the file system,registry,network
 interact with malware to  learn more about it
